# Page factory and POM::

Important Points to be noted:
1.In src/main/java ,Pages which are created for reusable locators and methods (POM),should not extend (inherit) base class.
2.In src/main/java, In Each Page class , Webdriver should be declared globally
    Ex:- public WebDriver driver;

3. In src/main/java, Each Page class should also have a constructor with WebDriver as Parameter 
to Initialize the Page driver with Base class driver when object is created for the Page class.

4. PageFactory class should be referred to use initelements , to initialize the webelements with driver
    Ex:- public Page(WebDriver driver){
    
         this.driver=driver;
         
         PageFactory.initelements(driver,this)
    
    }
    
5. In Src/test/java, Test classes should extend(inherit) Base Class.

6. Base class driver variable should be the implicit driver variable for Test class, 

Hence, we should not Explicitly declare driver again for Test class.

7. No need of constructor again in Test class.

8. Inorder to use reusable methods of Page classes of src/main/java in scr/test/ java test classes,
Objects should be created for the page classes.

9. IMP : Objects should be created for the page classes inside the Test Methods..but not globally inside the class.
